# Portify Backend

This folder contains the backend code for the Portify project. It is built with Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Installation

To run the backend application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedhosam283843/Portify.git
    ```
    
2. Change directory:

    ```bash
    cd .\backend\
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The backend server will start running on the default port. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up and configure the database connection in the code accordingly.
